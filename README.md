# Java / JSP Guessing Game Project

Following along with Java / Servlet / JSP Project by Craig Piercy's Youtube Channel.
["An Introduction to Java Server Pages with the Eclipse IDE"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNUXdYCM8eNcRQKsib_XKKsy5kYN30Lh7)


This second series modies a copy (clone in my case) the first project:
["An Introduction to Java Servlets with the Eclipse IDE"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNUXdYCM8eNfvLuPFaJpqcgS2JUx1PLXC)

The second series created a controller class and migrated all the business logic from view processing in index.jsp to processing in GameServlet.java, but then assembled the entire response (index.jsp) with the new values inside the controller as an example of the 'mirror image bad form' demonstrated in the first series/project.
