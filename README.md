# Java / JSP Guessing Game Project

Following along with Java / Servlet / JSP Project by Craig Piercy's Youtube Channel.
[First Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNUXdYCM8eNcRQKsib_XKKsy5kYN30Lh7)

Modifies a clone of the first project as a second project.

I'm following along with the second series:
["An Introduction to Java Servlets with the Eclipse IDE"]9https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNUXdYCM8eNfvLuPFaJpqcgS2JUx1PLXC)

The second series created a controller class and migrated all the business logic from view processing in index.jsp to processing in GameServlet.java, but then assembled the entire response (index.jsp) with the new values inside the controller as an example of the 'mirror image bad form' demonstrated in the first series/project.
